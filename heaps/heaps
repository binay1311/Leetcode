We use PriorityQueue class to implement Heaps in Java.

MinHeap is implemented as follows:
PriorityQueue<Integer> pQueue = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
(min elements at top of the heap)

MaxHeap in implemented as :
PriorityQueue<Integer> pQueue = new PriorityQueue<Integer>(Collections.reverseOrder());
(max elements at top of the heap)

heaps should be used when:
1. find kth
2. smallest/largest element

for kth smallest element - use maxheap

for kth largest element - use minheap
